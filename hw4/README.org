* Q1. Matrix multiplication

All programs I tried on cuda4 failed to terminate (including the sample programs given in class).
The CPU-based code in the programs ran, but the GPU-based part didn't.

| Server | GPU Bandwidth    |
|--------+------------------|
| Cuda1  | 0.90 GB/s        |
| Cuda2  | 2.61 GB/s        |
| Cuda3  | 3.30 GB/s        |
| Cuda4  | <not functional> |
| Cuda5  | 0.67 GB/s        |

A speedup of 25.12 was achieved over the OpemMP-based CPU code.

* Q2. Jacobi method (2D)
A speedup of 144.23 was achieved over the OpemMP-based CPU code.
